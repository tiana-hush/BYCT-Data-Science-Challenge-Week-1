# BYCT-Data-Science-Challenge-Week-1
This challenge aims to empower tech ethusiastics (like ME), applying for data scientist role at leading tech compamy to grow an attractive portfolio by demonstrating proficiency in Numpy.

Understanding Numpy:
NumPy is a core library for numerical computing in Python. 
By solving real-world problems with NumPy, you showcase your ability to handle complex data manipulation tasks efficiently.

Below are a few exercises to help highlight your technical skills but also your problem-solving abilities and creativity, making you a standout candidate to potential recruiters.

Problem and Instructions
Test your function for each question by feeding it with some input parameters.

1. Identity Twister: Create a function create_custom_identity(size, value, index) that takes three arguments:

size: Size of the square identity matrix (e.g., 4).

value: The value to insert at the specified index (e.g., 10).

index: A tuple representing the index (i, j) for the custom value.

The function should return a NumPy array representing the identity matrix with the specified value inserted at the given index.

2. Element Order Enigma: Write a function check_same_elements(arr1, arr2) that takes two NumPy arrays and returns True if both arrays contain the same elements regardless of their order, False otherwise. (Hint: Explore sorting and set comparisons).

3. Broadcasting Broadcast Buster: Write a function safe_add(arr1, arr2) that adds two NumPy arrays and handles potential broadcasting issues gracefully. The function should raise a specific error message if the shapes of the arrays are incompatible for addition.

4. Flattening the Terrain: Write a function flatten_terrain(terrain_data) that takes a 3D NumPy array representing terrain data (e.g., height at each point) and returns a 2D NumPy array representing the flattened height map.

5. Universal Absolute Value: Define a function absolute_all(arr) that takes a NumPy array and returns a new array with all elements converted to their absolute values.

6. Create Random Grayscale Image: Write Python code that:

    Imports the numpy library as np.

    Defines the desired image dimensions (width and height) using variables.

    Generates a random NumPy array filled with values representing grayscale 
    intensities.
    Remember, grayscale values typically range from 0 (black) to 
    255 (white).

    Visualization Power: Now that you have your random grayscale data, it's 
    time 
    to bring it to life! Import another Python library suitable for image 
    display.

    Matplotlib - A versatile library for data visualization, including images.

Bonus Challenge (optional):

   Modify your code (No. 6) to generate images with different value ranges 
   (e.g., 0-127) and observe how it impacts the grayscale appearance.

   Add functionalities to control the minimum and maximum grayscale 
   intensities for more creative control over your random image generation.
